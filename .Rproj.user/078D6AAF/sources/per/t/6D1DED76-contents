The following outputs are produced by this file: 

* `locations.csv` -- updated locations and their alternate names. Pay attention to the columns `adm2alt1en` and `adm2alt2en`: these are where the alternate names of each constituency have been recorded. Download [here](https://github.com/kenya-eie-wg/kenya_locations/blob/main/data/locations.csv)

* `locations_match.csv` -- file for matching sub-county pcodes with constituency pcodes. In long format, with all names and alternate names recorded under the column `adm2_en`. Download [here](https://github.com/kenya-eie-wg/kenya_locations/blob/main/data/locations_match.csv)

* `census_adm2_incomplete.csv` -- columns are listed below. But this is a collection of basic data at the sub-county level, including the population, average household size, and the breakdown of children by by age group. As noted, sub-county and constituency matching is incomplete. Download [here](https://github.com/kenya-eie-wg/kenya_locations/blob/main/data/census_adm2_incomplete.csv)

* `poverty.csv` -- county-level poverty incidence and counts. Download [here](https://github.com/kenya-eie-wg/kenya_locations/blob/main/data/poverty.csv)
